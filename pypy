To create the package for pypi.

Change the version in __init__.py, setup.py as well as docs/source/conf.py.

Commit these changes with the message: “Release: VERSION”

Add a tag in git to mark the release: “git tag VERSION -m’Adds tag VERSION for pypi’ ” Push the tag to git: git push –tags origin master

Build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).

For the wheel, run: “python setup.py bdist_wheel” in the top level directory. (this will build a wheel for the python version you use to build it).

For the sources, run: “python setup.py sdist” You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.

Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the pypi test server:

twine upload dist/* -r pypitest (pypi suggest using twine as other methods upload files via plaintext.) You may have to specify the repository url, use the following command then: twine upload dist/* -r pypitest –repository-url=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/

Check that you can install it in a virtualenv by running: pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi nlp

Upload the final version to actual pypi: twine upload dist/* -r pypi

Copy the release notes from RELEASE.md to the tag in github once everything is looking hunky-dory.

Update the documentation commit in .circleci/deploy.sh for the accurate documentation to be displayed

Update README.md to redirect to correct documentation.
